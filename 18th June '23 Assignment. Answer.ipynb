    "should you use logging over print statements in a real-world application?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer = \n",
    "{Logging}---------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose: Logging is a more flexible and feature-rich approach designed for capturing and managing application events, errors, and messages systematically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Levels: Logging supports different log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL), allowing you to control the verbosity of log messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Configuration: Logging can be configured centrally, allowing you to control the log levels, output destinations (e.g., console, files), and log message format in one place.\n",
    "Handlers and Formatters: Logging provides handlers and formatters to customize how log messages are processed and formatted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Granular Control: Logging allows you to log messages from various parts of your application and control the logging behavior globally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Integration: Logging is often used in larger applications, especially in server-side, backend, or long-running processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "{Print Statements}----------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose: Print statements are primarily used for simple and quick debugging or displaying information to the console during development.\n",
    "\n",
    "Levels: Print statements don't have different levels; they simply output text to the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "Configuration: Print statements are not configurable; they output information directly to the console.\n",
    "Limited Features: Print statements lack the features provided by logging, such as log levels, handlers, formatters, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Verbosity: Print statements are straightforward but can clutter the code and may be challenging to manage in larger applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Temporary Debugging: Print statements are often used temporarily during development for quick checks or debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "{When to Use Logging Over Print Statements}---------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Production Code: Use logging for production code where systematic event tracking, error handling, and log levels are essential.\n",
    "Long-Running Processes: Logging is suitable for applications that run continuously or for an extended period, providing a structured way to capture events.\n",
    "Error Handling: Logging is crucial for capturing and handling errors gracefully, allowing you to diagnose issues efficiently.\n",
    "Configurability: If you need to change the log levels, output destinations, or formatting globally, logging is the more suitable choice.\n",
    "Multiple Modules/Classes: In applications with multiple modules or classes, logging allows you to organize and centralize log messages effectively."
